# Looks like the 4x4 image ('23700') has DN level of 3500 with 10 sec
# 1x1 image ('0624') has DN level of 123 with 3 sec.
# So, we would expect 4x4 to have 16 x 10 / 3 ~ 50x the DN level of the 1x1. And indeed that is true.
# So images are bascially saturated as expected. Ugh. 
# The '2100' image has a negative DN value. Not sure why. But it is also a long 4x4 - intended for depth -- and
# just got swamped by stray light. Not by a super amount... but just barely. Would have been just fine as 1x1's, although
# maybe would have had a small amount of smear.
# This agrees w/ e-mail from Hal 3-Jul-2016. But I just wanted to load images and verify.
