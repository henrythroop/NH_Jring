    """
    Function takes a WCS header, and offsets it by a specified number of pixels.
    
    This changes the value of CRVAL (ie, the RA/Dec val of the center point). Nothing else is changed.
    
    The WCS passed is modified in place. There is no return value.
    
    This function is standalone -- not part of any class.
    
    Note that if I translate by 100 pixels, and then back by -100 pixels, I do not reach 
    exactly the starting location. It is close, but not exact. I think this is OK, but I'm
    not totally sure the reason.
     
    'x' is horizontal direction (as plotted by matplotlib).
    'y' is vertical   direction
    
    Parameters
    -----
    
    dx_pix, dy_pix:
        Amount to translate by, in pixels in the x and y directions. x and y are vertical and horizontal, 
        as per matplotlib images.
