    """
    Function takes a WCS header, and offsets it by a specified number of pixels.
    
    This changes the value of CRPIX (ie, which pixel is defined as the center).
    At first I was modidfying only CRVAL (ie, the RA/Dec val of the center point), but that 
    had was only 'mostly' accurate, and applying a negative translation didn't totally undo it.
    
    The WCS passed is modified in place. There is no return value.
    
    This function is standalone -- not part of any class.
    
    Note that if I translate by 100 pixels, and then back by -100 pixels, I do not reach 
    exactly the starting location. It is close, but not exact. I think this is OK, but I'm
    not totally sure the reason.
     
    'x' is horizontal direction (as plotted by matplotlib). Positive means to translate to the right.
    'y' is vertical   direction.                            Positive means to translate up (with origin=0 set).
    
    Parameters
    -----
    
    dx_pix, dy_pix:
        Amount to translate by, in pixels in the x and y directions. x and y are vertical and horizontal, 
        as per matplotlib images.
